                              Honestly, that’s a fantastic name for a movie.Besides being a cool movie title, it is one among a
                              million questions we encounter in our lifetime.Each one asking to be answered so as to get to the
                              next one.Some we grow tired of answering and others we dare not attempt to answer and then there
                              are the weird ones whose origins we seek desperately.If you ever wondered why these questions
                              arise in the first place, we must travel back to the beginning of time.<br><br>

                              They say need is the mother of invention.I disagree.I think it is questions.Because the true
                              inspiration for anything man does comes from his inability to answer some questions.What we call
                              need is our pursuit to answer these questions and in this journey, we stumble upon more and more
                              questions.Every discovery made in science, every masterpiece in art, every revolution in history
                              is an outcome of the attempt to answer some questions.Can man go faster than a horse? A simple
                              question that led to the invention of the steam locomotive.How do I preserve this marvelous
                              nightscape? And so Van Gogh painted the Starry Nights.We all know what “Why should we eat cake?”
                              did to the French.<br><br>

                              When people asked who created everything, religion was born and when the question became how was
                              everything created, science too found its way into this world.And because they had different
                              answers to a similar question, more questions arose.Is science and religion the same thing? Are
                              we living in universe with heaven above and hell below? 400 years after Galileo answered that
                              question, a new question arrives.If we are living in a multiverse, could the other universes be
                              heaven and hell? In fact, questions are the reason why religion has its beliefs and science has
                              its theories.<br><br>

                              Maybe the first sentence we might have ever heard is question like “Who’s dada?” or “Do you know
                              your Aunt Dorothy?”[“Of course, we met once in a pub”.Duh! Grow old Aunt Dorothy!].Ever since we
                              were babies, our minds are molded by such simple questions and in doing so we are prompted to
                              respond to questions.Only questions.We never listen to teachers saying “You should do your
                              homework!”.When the teacher saying,”Where’s your homework?” echoes through our mind, only then do
                              we actually start on it.And with generations taught to answer questions posed by others, we forget
                              to ask a few to ourselves.<br><br>

                              We hear more of “What are you planning after graduation?” than “What should I do after graduation?”
                              The former question compels us to come up with an answer that they find satisfactory.The latter
                              however can be answered by a free mind and though it will take longer to answer, it will always be
                              in our best interest.In a place where people are taught to answer other’s questions, what will
                              happen when the questions just stop.<br><br>

                              I believe people would then start to ask questions to themselves, like Newton and Maxwell did
                              before they became who they are now.How does time works?Are we alone in the universe? Is there an
                              afterlife? Who am I? Question the nature of reality and as you embark on a journey to find its
                              answers, explore its mysteries from a different perspective.Ask more questions. I think that is the
                              secret to achieving true freedom of thought.And to all those minds who had that privilege, you are
                              the maestros ,without doubt.Without questions.</p>
