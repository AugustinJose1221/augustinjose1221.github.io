          <p align="justify"> Internet service was introduced in India in 1995.Yes, nothing much could be done with a download
                              speed of 9.6kbit/s.The vastness of its facilities and the extent of its boundaries created a
                              need for faster internet speeds.Broadband was introduced in 2005 and then came the 3G revolution
                              in 2008.Advent of 4G technology along with Reliance Jio revolutionizing the telecom sector,
                              internet speeds have become faster than ever.But where do people use this 5Mbps internet
                              connection? Not loading few web pages obviously.Mainly downloading videos or more precisely,
                              downloading porn.<br><br>

                              After the introduction of Jio and their mind boggling tariff plans, there’s been a 75% rise in
                              porn viewership using smartphones.A large percentage of people in the age group of 15 to 40 use
                              much of their time on the internet watching or downloading porn.Thus India tops the world in the
                              number of porn viewer.Could this be connected to why India is up top in the number of unemployed
                              graduates.<br><br>

                              Shouldn’t internet and its facilities supposed to help eliminate unemployment?Instead, there has
                              been a decrease of 9% increase in unemployed college graduates between 2005 and 2008, about when
                              broadband hits India homes.It became 11% from 2009 to 2013.Since 2016, that number has gone up
                              to 20% with almost 18 million students graduate colleges to find themselves without any jobs.<br><br>

                              Besides the decrease in employed graduates, there has also been a decrease in their quality.
                              Productivity of Indian students has come down.One could argue half the scientists at NASA are
                              Indians. Well, how many of them are newly recruited.This fall in student performance is a result
                              of porn addiction.Our time and talent are being wasted as we stroll down this rabbit hole.And all
                              the mental and health issues that comes with this package doesn’t even require an introduction.<br><br>

                              What could be the worst thing that can happen to a person watching porn.Half of them porn sites
                              being insecure, let’s say an unfriendly bloke hacked your PC.Oops.He has all your information,
                              your password, your third cousin’s favorite color.In short everything you never wanted anyone to
                              know.And the biggest problem.You can’t go cry to your mother, “I’ve been hacked while watching
                              porn”.</p>
